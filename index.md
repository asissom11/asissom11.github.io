# Artifact Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

The first artifact I decided to improve and upload to this portfolio is the Android mobile inventory management app from CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. I chose this artifact because I thought it represented a significant enough challenge that I could show some skill in overcoming. In any case, this artifact is meant to showcase primarily a multifactor authentication feature as well as some other minor additions including improved CRUD operations and aesthetics. The multifactor authentication feature showcases the skills I have developed and the tenacity I’ve acquired through my time in the computer science program. At the end of this effort, I can say that I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. With the implementation of two-factor authentication, I exhibited a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

This was by no means an easy project to revive and fix, let alone improve upon, so I’m particularly proud of the way the 2FA worked out. I am still far from fluent in Java and SQLite, but thanks to this project I am much more comfortable with both languages and how they can be used in tandem. Additionally, it was important for me to focus on getting the architecture and design piece correct so that everything could fall into place more naturally. I was somewhat right about it being a challenge, and although it may have been a little bit more on the ambitious side of challenging, I stuck with it and got it across the line. Looking forward, this artifact looks to be the hardest in terms of skill level so I’m excited to get it into my ePortfolio and close the book on it so I can move forward.

# Artifact Enhancement Two: Data Structures and Algorithms

The selected artifact for the databases category is the Grazioso Salvare Rescue Animal Web App from SNHU’s CS-340 Client/Server Development course. This web application is designed to create a user-friendly interface that works with existing animal shelter databases to identify and categorize dogs suitable for rescue training and is built using Python and the Dash framework, with a non-relational MongoDB database. Python integration with MongoDB is handled by the PyMongo driver, which enables both database connection and manipulation with queries.

Specific reasons for inclusion of this enhanced artifact into my ePortfolio include demonstration of technical skill, problem-solving and adaptability, and alignment with industry standards. Recreating the project in a Windows environment was important in showing my ability to communicate clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. The app’s core functions include importing CSV data files of available shelter animals into MongoDB, as well as managing dependencies like the PyMongo driver, various Python libraries, the Dash framework, and a Python CRUD module to manipulate the data in MongoDB. This artifact follows a multi-faceted architecture using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and RESTful protocols, making it a relevant and modern artifact to showcase development work.

The benefit of using the MVC pattern is its separation of concerns and in this structure, the model manages data with MongoDB and Python, the view controls the user interface through the Dash framework, and the controller handles data interactions between the model and view using the PyMongo driver. Each record in the MongoDB database is stored as a machine-readable BSON document, which the web app retrieves and displays in a human-readable JSON format. When the main app file is executed, the user can open a new browser tab, navigate to the appropriate address, and view the client-facing dashboard.
